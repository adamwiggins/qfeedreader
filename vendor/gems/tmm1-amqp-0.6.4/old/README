Simple AMQP client for Ruby/EventMachine.

To use with RabbitMQ, first run the server:

  hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen
  hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server
  cd rabbitmq-server
  make run

Then run the client:

  ruby amqpc.rb

The client includes some basic specs (requires bacon >= 0.9.10). To run them:

  bacon amqpc.rb

The amqp_spec.rb file is generated automatically based on the AMQP specification. To generate it:

  ruby codegen.rb > amqp_spec.rb

This project was inspired by py-amqplib, rabbitmq, qpid and rubbyt.
